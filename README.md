# hello-world
My first repository

I am fairly new to programming, but have a passion and great desire to want to learn as much as I can in the world of web development (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript), as I'm interested in becoming a full stack developer. I'm also interested in learning other programming languages, such as C#, C++, and Python. One of my long-term goals is to eventually develop my own game with my daughter who is also passionate about making games.
